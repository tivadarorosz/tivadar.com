# Homepage Simplification Summary

## Created Files
- `src/index-simplified.njk` - Simplified HTML structure
- `src/styles/pages/_home-simplified.scss` - Simplified styles
- Backup files with timestamps for all original files

## Key Improvements

### 1. HTML Structure Simplification
- Renamed classes to be more consistent (e.g., `hero-column-left` â†’ `hero-left`)
- Removed redundant wrapper divs
- Standardized section naming patterns
- Used shared components where possible (e.g., `bottom-cta-section`)

### 2. CSS/SCSS Improvements
- **Removed duplicated styles**: Eliminated duplicate CTA styling between homepage and component
- **Simplified decorative elements**: 
  - Hero image decoration now uses `box-shadow` instead of complex pseudo-elements
  - Portfolio items use padding/background instead of absolute positioning
- **Consistent spacing**: Used CSS custom properties throughout (e.g., `var(--spacing-lg)`)
- **Removed !important declarations**: All styles now work through proper specificity
- **Better BEM naming**: Used modifier classes like `hero-featured-image--decorated`
- **Centralized typography**: Created reusable `.section-title` and `.section-text` classes

### 3. Reduced Complexity
- Removed unnecessary media query duplication
- Simplified grid layouts using modern CSS Grid
- Eliminated complex positioning calculations
- Made mobile-first approach more consistent

### 4. Better Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns between sections
- More predictable class naming patterns
- Easier to debug and modify
- Better commenting and organization

## How to Implement

1. Review the simplified files:
   - `/src/index-simplified.njk`
   - `/src/styles/pages/_home-simplified.scss`

2. Test locally by:
   - Replacing current homepage with simplified version
   - Updating SCSS imports to use simplified file
   - Running build process and checking visual output

3. To revert changes:
   - Use the timestamped backup files created
   - `src/index.njk.backup-[timestamp]`
   - `src/styles/pages/_home.scss.backup-[timestamp]`

## Next Steps
- Test the simplified version in different browsers
- Verify all functionality remains intact
- Consider applying similar simplification patterns to other pages
- Update any JavaScript that may rely on changed class names

## Benefits
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Reduced CSS file size
- Better performance (simpler selectors)
- More consistent with rest of the codebase
- Clearer structure for future modifications
